# ðŸŽ¯ Query Enhancement Features Added

## What Was Fixed

The issue was that short queries like "summarize" were too vague for the RAG system to understand what the user wanted to summarize. Here's what I added:

## ðŸ”§ New Features

### 1. Query Enhancement Function
- **Function**: `enhance_query()`
- **Purpose**: Automatically expands short/vague queries into more specific ones
- **Examples**:
  - "summarize" â†’ "Please provide a comprehensive summary of the uploaded documents"
  - "explain" â†’ "Please explain the main concepts and points from the uploaded documents"
  - "main points" â†’ "What are the main points covered in the uploaded documents?"

### 2. Improved RAG Prompts
- **Better Context Handling**: The system now better understands document-related queries
- **Smart Interpretation**: Vague questions are interpreted in the context of uploaded documents
- **Comprehensive Responses**: Enhanced prompts for better, more detailed answers

### 3. User Feedback
- **Query Interpretation Hints**: Shows users how their short query was interpreted
- **Example**: When you type "summarize", it shows "ðŸ’¡ I interpreted your query as: 'Please provide a comprehensive summary of the uploaded documents'"

### 4. Example Query Buttons
- **Quick Access**: Added sidebar buttons with common queries
- **One-Click Questions**: Users can click buttons like "summarize", "main points", etc.
- **Instant Processing**: Queries are processed immediately when buttons are clicked

### 5. Enhanced Chat Input
- **Better Placeholder**: Shows examples of what users can ask
- **Guidance**: "Ask a question about your documents... (try: 'summarize', 'main points', 'explain')"

## ðŸŽ¯ Supported Short Queries

The system now intelligently handles these short queries:

| Short Query | Enhanced Version |
|-------------|------------------|
| "summarize" | "Please provide a comprehensive summary of the uploaded documents" |
| "summary" | "Please provide a comprehensive summary of the uploaded documents" |
| "explain" | "Please explain the main concepts and points from the uploaded documents" |
| "what is this" | "What are these documents about? Please provide an overview" |
| "tell me" | "Tell me about the content of the uploaded documents" |
| "describe" | "Describe the main content and key points from the uploaded documents" |
| "overview" | "Provide an overview of the uploaded documents" |
| "main points" | "What are the main points covered in the uploaded documents?" |
| "key points" | "What are the key points covered in the uploaded documents?" |
| "important" | "What are the important points from the uploaded documents?" |
| "analyze" | "Please analyze the content of the uploaded documents" |
| "analysis" | "Please provide an analysis of the uploaded documents" |

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **User Types Short Query**: User types "summarize"
2. **Query Enhancement**: System detects it's vague and enhances it
3. **User Feedback**: Shows interpretation hint to user
4. **RAG Processing**: Enhanced query is sent to the RAG system
5. **Better Results**: System returns comprehensive response
